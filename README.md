# Yellow Pages

## Description
Yellow Pages is a console application built using Entity Framework Core that allows you to store and manage contacts in a SQLite database. 📖
### Still scratching my head with
- A menu system that makes sense
- In-app mail service for sending messages to contacts
- Potential in-app text messaging

## Getting Started
To get started with the Yellow Pages application, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the documentation for setting up the database and running the app.

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by C# Academy's [Phonebook Project](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/16/phonebook).
